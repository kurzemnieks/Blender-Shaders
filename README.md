# Blender-Shaders

Some experimental shaders I have been creating in Blender.


# NGon shader
Generates procedural NGon shapes based on UV map. Supports rotation, scale, edge blending, tiling. You can combine several shaders to achieve more complex patterns.

# Procedural cubic tile materialize shader
Generates 3D tiles in world space, indepentant from UV or geometry topology. 
Allows to do cool teleportation effect.
